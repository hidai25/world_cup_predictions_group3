          <li><a>Stealth phase: In this phase, a small community of hobbyists know about the asset and its potential. They are those who understand the emerging opportunity and act accordingly with big purchases at a low price of the asset. Generally, they do so very quietly. These are habitually called “smart money investors”.</a></li>
          <li><a>Awareness Phase: The momentum is being noticed and many investors join the purchasing spree.This phase can be accompanied by sudden price drops. At this time, “smart money investors” strengthen their positions.</a></li>
          <li><a>Mania Phase: The general public notices the price increase following large media coverage and they start buying in large quantities. This, in turn, causes very fast price increase in a short period of time. At the end of this phase, “smart money investors” start to liquidate their positions at a large profit .</a></li>
          <li><a>Blow-Off phase: Generally there is some trigger moment  that causes the general public to think that something has changed. The decline in price start off very slowly. As the sell-off speeds up, investors panic, and prices reverse course and descend much faster than they increased.</a></li>

    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li><a>Low interest rates are commonly a very strong contributing factor to an an asset bubble. Investors can borrow cheaply and they don't receive a good return on their fixed income type investment assets. Therefore, investors look for yield and thus invest in higher risk higher return ass. In the long term It makes prices in different asset reach abnormal leveles.</a></li>
      <li><a>Sometimes an asset class become very popular among the investor community. Prices of this asset class soar and create a “herd” behavior amongst investors and the public. Nevertheless, economics indicators don’t always reflect this isolated behavior which make policy-makers overlook it.</a></li>
      <li><a>The classical economic law of supply and demand apply to situation where the supply of a certain asset/commodity is shrinked suddenly. This make investors buy that asset following a belief that supply will shrink even more in the future. It makes the price of this asset skyrocket.</a></li>
