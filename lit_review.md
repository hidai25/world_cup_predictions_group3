World Cup 2018 was played in Russia. This was the 21st FIFA World Cup. It took place from
14th June to 15 July 2018. Based on the friendly matches played, Germany was a top
contender however in the actual game the team was out of the games in the first round.
Another talented team Spain fired their coach one week before the beginning of the World
Cup impacting their wins although there is no certain way to validate.
